# bark_whisperer

A simple web app to turn your speech into text and back into someone else's speech.

Also contains my command line tools to conveniently wrap bark and whisper and do nice pipeline things, like removing empty spaces and such:

 - howl: Long form TTS
 - murmur: Long form STT
 - gossip: Voice cloning for bark
